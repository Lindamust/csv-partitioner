needed some way to partition a csv file in a very uncommon and odd way in order to do some operations.
therefore im making this thing rq.
also a good chance to learn rust.

TODO:
build proper README.md later


what i have learned:
dont fight the borrow checker
your first idea is probably dogshit and you should look into every possible way to do somthing before commiting heavily
docs take up 70% of the lines of code
